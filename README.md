# CarsiDock-Cov

CarsiDock-Cov is a deep learning-based protocol for automated covalent docking. It inherits the core components of [CarsiDock]((https://github.com/carbonsilicon-ai/CarsiDock/tree/main)), but makes a few changes  to facilitate the applicability of the whole protocol for covalent docking.
